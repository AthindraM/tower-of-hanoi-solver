# Tower of Hanoi Solver
I made this program as a small and fun mini-project to apply my C++ knowledge.
As of right now, it can calculate up to 64 disks, but unfortunatley not more than that.
In the future, I shall see if I can expand it so it can support a greater number of disks, and also if it can calculate some fun facts, such as finding out how long it would take to move all the disks if you made a move a second/minute/hour.
